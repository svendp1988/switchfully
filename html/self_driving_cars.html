            <h1>Distant future?</h1>
            <p>I don't believe it will take much longer for self driving cars to take over our roads. Although some recent events (Uber, Tesla, Volvo) have proven that we're not completely there yet.
            There's so many players involved racing to be first (Uber, Volvo, Google, Tesla, Nvidia and rougly 94 percent of traffic accidents are caused by human error. The pressure is on.</p>

            <h3>Zero-incident future</h3>
            <p>Humans will never be able to react and respond as quickly as computers can. Take the flawed human parts out of the equasion and a zero-incident future seems a real possibility.
            The introduction of 5G networks is yet another big step for cars to communicate with other cars on the road, thus making for greater predictability in traffic.</p>
            <h3>The potential</h3>
            <p>Imagine electrical driven automated vehicules that can drive by night without any level of interference by its driver. Traffic would be reduced, productivity would go up, polution by exhaust fuels down.</p>
            <h3>Obstacles</h3>
            <p>Sure there are many obstacles to overcome. Not only ethical (whose fault is it when an accident does happen?), but technical and structural problemes will have to be tackled.
            But aren't the challenges what makes it so exiting. Everybody's being pushed to the maximum of their capabilities. New technologies are being invented on almost a daily basis. Everybody's
            racing to be the first to come up with that magical solution that takes driving to the next level.</p>
