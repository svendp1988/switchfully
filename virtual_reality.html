            <h1>Just for gaming?</h1>
            <p>Boys like games. So it goes without saying that the first thing that comes to mind when many of us hear virtual reality is gaming. Yet its use and benefits reach far beyond just gaming.</p>

            <h3>VR in entertainment</h3>
            <p>VR is everywhere. From movie theaters, to amusement parcs to gaming. Everybody is trying to gives us the biggest scare or the biggest adrenaline rush using Virtual Reality. And they're getting quite
            good at it as well. Think about rollercoasters in which you can wear VR goggles so you can ride up the Mt. Everest... And fall off.</p>
            <h3>But its true potential</h3>
            <p>An important area of application for VR systems has always been training for real-life activities. The appeal of simulations is that they can provide training equal or nearly equal to practice with real systems,
                but at reduced cost and with greater safety. This is particularly the case for military training. It's true potential therefor lays in its powers to simulate real life experiences without the risk.
                Thus making it an excellent tool to train soldiers, pilots or surgeons. </p>
            <h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
            <p>On top of virtual reality there's augmented reality. Which is basically the same thing, except you augment the reality you see around you. For example it would be perfectly possible to
            see your own room, with everybody standing in it, but have a dinosaur wander around there with you. For this reason a lot of people, including Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) believe Augmented Reality
            will be far more important than Virtual Reality.</p>
